Welcome to my portfolio website. This site is part blog, part project showcase, and part experiment. I've never done any web development before, I'm much more comfortable writing Verilog, or designing embedded systems.

### [MIPS CPU](/mips-cpu)
This is the largest digital design project I've completed. This project represents the work of myself and on other student as we worked together in a Computer Architecture course to build a dual core MIPS CPU. It was a great project to dig a little deeper into some of the pillars of modern computer architecture.

### [Tetris hand-held console](/tetris)
It's Tetris! You already know what to do! This project was a four person effort to build a portable Tetris game from scratch. We programmed in C on bare metal, we fabricated a custom PCB, and ultimately we succeeded in creating a fun (even addicting) game with persistent high-scores! It's an old-school arcade game in your hand.

### [POCAR GPS real-time tracking](/pocar)
I was heavily involved with the Purdue Outing Club throughout all four and half years at Purdue. This class project aimed to provide real-time tracking for our annual wilderness orienteering race. The idea is that racing teams cannot use our device to find their own location (they have to navigate by map and compass), but the race coordinators can see the positions of the teams in real time on a web-app.

### [Musical-lights system](/musical-lights)
I heard about individually addressable LED strips and immediately started thinking about cool ways to light up my room. This project is my attempt to create something with RGB LEDs that isn't tacky. The system taps into my Spotify account and sets the ambient color of the LEDs according to the "mood" of the song. The project has grown to include the lights on the case fans of my desktop, as well as the RGB lights on my keyboard.

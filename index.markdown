This is my website. I'm not a front end developer. But hopefully this site can showcase some interesting projects I've worked on!

# Projects:

  * [MIPS CPU](/mips-cpu/summary.html)
  * [Tetris hand-held console](/tetris/summary.html)
  * [POCAR GPS real-time tracking](/pocar/summary.html)
  * [Musical-lights system](/musical-lights/summary.html)

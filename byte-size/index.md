# Byte-size projects
These are the projects that don't merit their own sections, but are still worth writing about.

### [IBM Wheelwriter30](wheelwriter)
Two years ago I picked up an IBM Wheelwriter30 (a paper teletype console) at the Purdue surplus store. I removed the keyboard from the larger machine with the intention of creating a USB keyboard with it but it sat in my parents garage until the fall of 2020. I recently bought a Planck keyboard running the open source QMK firmware, so I had a great starting place from which to reverse engineer the IBM Wheelwriter.
